# Contributing to claude-code-harness

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **claude-code-harness**! This document provides guidelines for contributing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title describing the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Claude Code version and OS

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes locally
5. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "feat: add new feature"`
6. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. Open a Pull Request

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Code Style

- Use clear, descriptive names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep commands/agents/skills focused on single responsibilities

```

### Adding a New Command

1. Create `commands/your-command.md`
2. Follow the existing command structure
3. Update README.md with the new command

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/your-agent.md`
2. Define the agent with YAML frontmatter
3. Update README.md (recommended)

> Note: agents/ are auto-discovered by Claude Code. You typically do not need to manually enumerate them in `plugin.json`.

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/your-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Define trigger phrases
3. Update README.md

## Version Management

Version is defined in two places that must stay in sync:
- `VERSION` - Source of truth
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Used by plugin system

### Version Scripts

```bash
# Check if versions are in sync
./scripts/sync-version.sh check

# Sync plugin.json to VERSION
./scripts/sync-version.sh sync

# Bump patch version (e.g., 2.0.0 → 2.0.1)
./scripts/sync-version.sh bump
```

### Version Consistency Checks

- **Local (recommended)**: run `./scripts/sync-version.sh check` before committing
- **CI (recommended)**: run `./tests/validate-plugin.sh` and `./scripts/ci/check-consistency.sh` on PRs

---

## Testing

Before submitting:

1. Validate plugin structure and consistency:

   ```bash
   ./tests/validate-plugin.sh
   ./scripts/ci/check-consistency.sh
   ```

2. (Recommended) Enable pre-commit hooks (auto bump patch version when code changes):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
   ```

2. Test locally in a separate project using `--plugin-dir`:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your-project
   claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-code-harness
   ```

3. Verify commands work as expected (`/help`), and the core loop runs:

   - `/harness-init`
   - `/plan`
   - `/work`
   - `/harness-review`
