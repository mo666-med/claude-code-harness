![Claude harness](docs/images/claude-harness-logo-with-text.png)

**Elevate Solo Development to Pro Quality**

A development harness that runs Claude Code in an autonomous "Plan → Work → Review" cycle,
systematically preventing **confusion, sloppiness, accidents, and forgetfulness**.

## What's New in v2.9

### Full-Cycle Parallel Automation (v2.9.0)

**Run `/work --full` for automated implement → self-review → improve → commit cycles**

```bash
/work --full --parallel 3
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--full` | Enable full-cycle mode | false |
| `--parallel N` | Parallel worker count | 1 |
| `--isolation` | `lock` / `worktree` | lock |
| `--commit-strategy` | `task` / `phase` / `all` | task |
| `--deploy` | Auto-deploy after commit | false |

**4-Phase Architecture**:
1. **Phase 1**: Dependency graph → Parallel task-workers → Self-review
2. **Phase 2**: Codex 8-parallel cross-review
3. **Phase 3**: Conflict resolution → Final build verification → Conventional Commit
4. **Phase 4**: Deploy (optional, with safety gate)

See [docs/PARALLEL_FULL_CYCLE.md](docs/PARALLEL_FULL_CYCLE.md) for details.

## What's New in v2.7

### Codex Second Opinion Review (v2.7.9+)

- Codex is optionally integrated into `/harness-review` (config: `review.codex.enabled` in `.claude-code-harness.config.yaml`)
- Run `/codex-review` for a Codex-only review

### Evaluation Suite (Scorecard) (v2.7.9+)

- Generate `scorecard.md` / `scorecard.json` from benchmark results (`benchmarks/results/*.json`)
- Spec: [Scorecard Spec](docs/SCORECARD_SPEC.md) | Ops: [Evals Playbook](docs/EVALS_PLAYBOOK.md)

---

## What's New in v2.6

### Quality Gate System (v2.6.2)

**Auto-suggest appropriate quality standards at the right time**

| Gate Type | Targets | Suggestion |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **TDD** | `[feature]` tag, `src/core/` | "Would you like to write tests first?" |
| **Security** | Auth/API/Payments | Security checklist displayed |
| **a11y** | UI Components | Accessibility check |
| **Performance** | DB queries, loops | N+1 query warning |

- **Suggestions, not enforcement** (VibeCoder-friendly)
- Auto-assigns quality markers when creating plans with `/plan-with-agent`

### Claude-mem Integration (v2.6.0)

```bash
/harness-mem  # Integrate Claude-mem
```

**Learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them**

- Auto-reference past test tampering warnings and build error solutions
- `impl` / `review` / `verify` skills leverage past knowledge
- Important learnings can be promoted to SSOT (decisions.md/patterns.md)

### Skill Hierarchy Reminder (v2.6.1)

When using a parent skill, **related child skills are auto-suggested**.
No more wondering "which skill should I read?"

## In 3 Lines

| Command | What it does | Result |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `/plan-with-agent` | Brainstorm → Plan | **Plans.md** created |
| `/work` | Execute plan (parallel support) | Working code |
| `/harness-review` | Multi-perspective review | Pro quality |

![Quick Overview](docs/images/quick-overview.png)

## 4 Problems Solved

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Confusion** | Don't know what to do | `/plan-with-agent` to organize |
| **Sloppiness** | Quality drops | `/harness-review` for multi-perspective check |
| **Accidents** | Dangerous operations | Hooks for auto-guard |
| **Forgetfulness** | Missing context | SSOT + Claude-mem for continuity |

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Requirements

- **Claude Code v2.1.6+** (recommended for full feature support)
- See [docs/CLAUDE_CODE_COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_COMPATIBILITY.md) for version compatibility details

### 1. Install

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
claude

# Add marketplace → Install
/plugin marketplace add Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness
/plugin install claude-code-harness@claude-code-harness-marketplace
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
/harness-init
```

### 3. Development Loop

```bash
/plan-with-agent  # Plan
/work             # Implement
/harness-review   # Review
```

<details>
<summary>Local Clone (for developers)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chachamaru127/claude-code-harness.git ~/claude-plugins/claude-code-harness
cd /path/to/your-project

## Who Is This For?

| User | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| **Solo Developers** | Balance speed and quality |
| **Freelancers** | Submit review results as deliverables |
| **VibeCoder** | Drive development with natural language |
| **Cursor Users** | 2-Agent workflow for role separation |

---

## Features

### Safety (Hooks)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Protected Path Guard** | Reject writes to `.git/`, `.env`, secret keys |
| **Dangerous Command Confirmation** | Require confirmation for `git push`, `rm -rf`, `sudo` |
| **Safe Command Allow** | Auto-allow `git status`, `npm test` |

### Continuity (SSOT + Memory)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **decisions.md** | Accumulate decisions (Why) |
| **patterns.md** | Accumulate reusable patterns (How) |
| **Claude-mem Integration** | Leverage past learnings across sessions |

### Quality Assurance (3-Layer Defense)

| Layer | Mechanism | Enforcement |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Layer 1 | Rules (test-quality.md, etc.) | Conscience-based |
| Layer 2 | Skills built-in guardrails | Contextual enforcement |
| Layer 3 | Hooks for tampering detection | Technical enforcement |

**Prohibited Patterns**: Changes to `it.skip()`, assertion deletion, hollow implementations

## Cursor 2-Agent Workflow (Optional)

Say "I want to start 2-agent workflow" for auto-setup.

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Cursor (PM)** | Planning, Review, Task Management |
| **Claude Code (Worker)** | Implementation, Testing, Debugging |

**Workflow**:

Cursor: /plan-with-cc → /handoff-to-claude
Claude Code: /work → /handoff-to-cursor
Cursor: /review-cc-work → Approve or Request Fixes
```
