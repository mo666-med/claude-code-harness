## [2.9.1] - 2026-01-16

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Claude Code 2.1.x compatibility: smarter hooks, LSP guidance, and lightweight subagent init.**

#### Before/After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Quality rules only checked at review time | Quality guidelines injected during file edits via `additionalContext` |
| Subagents had same init overhead as main agent | Subagents get lightweight init (faster task-worker execution) |
| Manual code navigation for impact analysis | LSP guidance in impl/review skills (findReferences, goToDefinition) |
| Short hook timeouts caused failures | Extended timeouts for long-running hooks (up to 120s) |

### Added

- **PreToolUse additionalContext**: Injects quality guidelines when editing files
  - Test files → test-quality.md rules (no test tampering)
  - Source files → implementation-quality.md rules
- **SessionStart agent_type**: Subagents skip full initialization
- **LSP guidance**: impl/review skills now recommend LSP for code analysis
- **Compatibility docs**: `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_COMPATIBILITY.md` with version matrix

### Changed

- **Hook timeouts extended** (for Claude Code v2.1.3+):
  - usage-tracker: 10s → 30s
  - auto-test-runner: 30s → 120s
  - session-summary: 30s → 60s
  - auto-cleanup-hook: 30s → 60s
- **MCP auto mode** (v2.1.7+): Removed explicit MCPSearch calls from cursor-mem skill

---

## [2.9.0] - 2026-01-16

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Full-cycle parallel automation: implement → self-review → improve → commit in one command.**

#### Before/After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `/work` executes tasks one at a time | `/work --full --parallel 3` runs full cycle in parallel |
| Review was a separate manual step | Each task-worker self-reviews autonomously |
| Commits were manual | Auto-commit after `commit_ready` judgment |
| Same workspace risked file conflicts | `--isolation=worktree` for complete separation |

### Added

- **task-worker integration (Phase 32)**: `/work --full` automates implement → self-review → improve → commit
  - New agent `agents/task-worker.md` with 4-point self-review
  - 7 new options for `/work`: `--full`, `--parallel N`, `--isolation`, `--commit-strategy`, `--deploy`, `--max-iterations`, `--skip-cross-review`
- **4-phase parallel execution**: Dependency graph → task-workers → Codex cross-review → Commit
- **commit_ready criteria**: No Critical/Major issues, build success, tests pass

---

## [2.8.2] - 2026-01-14

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Codex parallel review now enforces individual MCP calls and smart expert filtering.**

#### Before/After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Experts might be combined in single MCP call | MANDATORY rules enforce individual parallel calls |
| Always called 8 experts | Smart filtering: only relevant experts for project type |
| Inconsistent tool names in docs | Unified to `mcp__codex__codex` |

### Fixed

- **MCP tool name** unified to `mcp__codex__codex` across all docs
- **"8 experts" → "up to 8 experts"** to clarify filtering applies
- **Document-only change rules** unified (Quality, Architect, Plan Reviewer, Scope Analyst priority)
- **MANDATORY parallel call rules** added to prevent expert consolidation

### Changed

- Expert filtering now considers:
  - Config-based (`enabled: false` → skip)
  - Project type (CLI/Backend → skip Accessibility, SEO)
  - Change content (docs only → skip Security, Performance)

---

## [2.8.1] - 2026-01-13

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**CI-only commands are now hidden from `/` completion.**

- `harness-review-ci`, `plan-with-agent-ci`, `work-ci` now have `user-invocable: false`

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-01-13

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Commit Guard + Codex Mode integration for quality gates.**

- **Auto-judgment**: APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES/REJECT with auto-fix loop

---

## [2.7.12] - 2026-01-11

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Codex now checks its own version and supports model selection.**

- **Codex CLI version check**: On first run, compares the installed Codex CLI version with the latest version and guides you through updating (runs `npm update -g @openai/codex` after approval).
- **Codex model selection**: Choose the model via config.
  - Default: `gpt-5.2-codex`
  - Options: `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5-codex-mini`

---

## [2.7.11] - 2026-01-11

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Codex is now a true parallel reviewer inside `/harness-review` — and its suggestions can be verified and turned into executable Plans.md tasks.**

#### Before/After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Codex ran after Claude reviews (sequential) | Codex runs as the 5th parallel reviewer |
| Codex output was shown as-is | Claude validates Codex findings and proposes vetted fixes |
| Review results were “display-only” | After approval, fixes are written to Plans.md and executed via `/work` |

---

## [2.7.10] - 2026-01-11

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**You can run Codex as a standalone reviewer with `/codex-review`, and `/harness-review` can auto-detect Codex on first run.**

- **New `/codex-review` command**: Runs a Codex-only second-opinion review.
- **First-run Codex detection (`once: true` hook)**: `/harness-review` checks whether Codex is installed and guides enablement when found.
- Added `scripts/check-codex.sh`.

---

## [2.7.9] - 2026-01-11

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

  - `skills/codex-review/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/codex-review/references/codex-mcp-setup.md`
  - `skills/codex-review/references/codex-review-integration.md`
- Added Codex integration guidance to the existing `review` skill:
  - `skills/review/references/codex-integration.md`
- Added `review.codex` config section (example):
  ```yaml
  review:
    codex:
      enabled: false
      auto: false
      prompt: "..."
  ```

---

## [2.7.8] - 2026-01-11

---

## [2.7.7] - 2026-01-11

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Skills now align with the official spec more closely (Progressive Disclosure), making them easier to discover and less fragile.**

- Migrated `doc.md` → `references/*.md` (43 files)
- Updated parent `SKILL.md` to the Progressive Disclosure pattern (14 skills)
- Removed non-official frontmatter field `metadata.skillport` (63 files)
- Fixed `vibecoder-guide/SKILL.md` name: `vibecoder-guide-legacy` → `vibecoder-guide`

#### Before/After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `skills/impl/work-impl-feature/doc.md` | `skills/impl/references/implementing-features.md` |
| Manual routing via `## Routing` + paths | “Details” table via Progressive Disclosure |
| Non-official `metadata.skillport` | Official fields only (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`) |

## [2.7.4] - 2026-01-10

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Sessions end smarter and cheaper with the Intelligent Stop Hook.**

- Consolidated 3 Stop scripts (check-pending, cleanup-check, plans-reminder) into a single `type: "prompt"` hook.
- Uses `model: "haiku"` to optimize cost/latency.
- Evaluates 5 angles on session stop: task completion, errors, follow-ups, Plans.md updates, cleanup recommendation.
- Kept `session-summary.sh` (command hook) as-is.
- Added `context: fork` to `ci` / `troubleshoot` skills to prevent context pollution.
- Added test coverage:
  - `tests/test-intelligent-stop-hook.sh`
  - `tests/test-hooks-sync.sh`

---

## [2.7.3] - 2026-01-08

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Fixed 2.6.x → 2.7.x migration compatibility so Stop hooks keep working even with older cached plugin versions.**

- `sync-plugin-cache.sh` now also syncs `.claude-plugin/hooks.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

---

## [2.7.2] - 2026-01-08

### 🎯 What's Changed for You

**Fixed compatibility with Claude Code 2.1.1 security changes that blocked `prompt`-type Stop hooks.**

  - `stop-cleanup-check.sh` (cleanup recommendation)
  - `stop-plans-reminder.sh` (Plans.md marker reminder)
- Fully synchronized `hooks/hooks.json` and `.claude-plugin/hooks.json`.

---
