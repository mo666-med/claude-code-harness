## [2.3.4] - 2025-12-17

### What's Changed for You

**Version auto-bumps on code changes. Works on Windows too.**

#### Before
- Had to manually run `./scripts/sync-version.sh bump` before commits
- Forgetting caused CI failures and double work

#### After
- **Auto version bump**: Patch version auto-increments on commits with code changes
- **Windows support**: Works from PowerShell/CMD with Git for Windows
- No more CI failures from forgetting version bumps

### Changes
- Fixed pre-commit hook encoding issues (Japanese → English messages)
- Added Windows compatibility docs to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `install-git-hooks.sh`
- Enable with `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`

---

## [2.3.3] - 2025-12-17

### What's Changed for You

**Skills are now organized by purpose. Easier to find what you need.**

#### Before
- Skills scattered across `core/`, `optional/`, `worker/`
- "Want to review" → Can't find where it is

#### After
- **14 categories**: impl, review, verify, setup, 2agent, memory, principles, auth, deploy, ui, workflow, docs, ci, maintenance
- **Find by purpose**: "Review" → `review` category, "Deploy" → `deploy` category

### Changes
- Reorganized skills into purpose-based categories (52 files changed)
- Added skill category table to CLAUDE.md
- Removed old categories (core, optional, worker)

### Acknowledgements
- Hierarchical skill structure: Implemented based on feedback from [AI Masao](https://note.com/masa_wunder)

---

## [2.3.1] - 2025-12-16

### What's Changed for You

**Skills activate more reliably.**

#### Before

- **Evaluation flow**: Auto-evaluates matching skills before work

### Changes
- Enhanced all skill descriptions (explicit trigger words)
- Added skill evaluation flow to CLAUDE.md

---

## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-17

- Hard to use for English users

#### After
- Language selection (JA/EN) in `/harness-init`
- All 16 commands have English descriptions (`description-en`)
- Set `i18n.language` in config file

### Changes
- Added language selection step to `/harness-init`

**License changed back to MIT. Contributing to official repo is now possible.**

#### Before (Proprietary License - v2.2.0)
- Redistribution and sales prohibited
- PR submissions to official repo not possible

#### After (MIT License)
- **Free distribution/redistribution**: Fork, PR, packaging allowed
- **Contributing to official repo possible**: PRs to Anthropic official plugins OK

## [2.2.1] - 2025-12-16

### What's Changed for You

**Agents work smarter.**

#### Before
- Unclear what tools agents could use
- Multiple parallel agents hard to distinguish
- Skill info crammed in one file, inefficient token usage

#### After
- Each agent's available tools are explicit, using only appropriate tools
- Agents have colors for easy identification during parallel execution
- Skills are hierarchical, loading only needed info for faster performance

### Changes

#### Agent Definitions (Official Format - 6 files)

```yaml
# Before
---
description: ...
capabilities: [...]
---

# After
---
name: code-reviewer
description: ...
tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Bash]
model: sonnet
color: blue
---
```

| Agent | Role | color |
|-------|------|-------|
| code-reviewer | Code review | blue |
| ci-cd-fixer | CI fixes | orange |
| error-recovery | Error recovery | red |
| project-analyzer | Project analysis | green |
| project-scaffolder | Project generation | purple |
| project-state-updater | State management | cyan |

#### Progressive Disclosure Skill Structure

```
# Before
skills/plans-management/
└── SKILL.md   # All info in one file

# After
skills/plans-management/
├── SKILL.md              # Core info only
├── references/
│   └── markers.md        # Detailed specs (load when needed)
└── examples/
    └── task-lifecycle.md # Examples (load when needed)
```

**Target skills**: plans-management, workflow-guide

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### What's Changed for You

## [2.1.2] - 2025-12-15

### What's Changed for You

**Parallel execution with just `/work`.**

#### Before
- Normal task execution: `/work`
- For parallel execution: `/parallel-tasks` (separate command)

#### After
- **Just `/work`**: Auto parallel execution when multiple independent tasks
- Fewer commands to remember (17 → 16)

### Changes

- `/work` auto-analyzes dependencies, decides parallel/serial

---

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-15

### What's Changed for You

**Far fewer commands to remember.**

#### Before
- Had to remember 27 commands
- Run individual commands like `/analytics`, `/auth`, `/deploy-setup`

#### After
- **Just 16 commands** needed
- Rest auto-activate by **just saying** "add auth", "setup deploy" (converted to skills)

### Changes
- Commands: 27 → 17
- `/plan` → `/plan-with-agent` renamed
- `/skill-list` shows available skills
- These became skills (auto-activate in conversation):
  - `/analytics`, `/auth`, `/auto-fix`, `/deploy-setup`, etc.
